YouTube Redact
===

A quick Chrome extension for "silencing" YouTube comments by using Redacted Script (https://github.com/christiannaths/Redacted-Font), a font by Christian Naths, recently posted on Hacker News.

Usage
---

Until I put this on the Google Chrome Web Store, in order to use this extension you must either clone this repository using git, or download a .zip of the repository and extract it somewhere. Then in the `Extensions` page in Chrome, enable `Developer mode` and click on `Load unpacked extension...` and select the extracted folder.

Now browsing to YouTube should change the comment font to Redacted Script, and keep your nerves calm :)

Font License

The font license can be found inside `OFL.txt`.
